# Advent-of-Code-2022
This is my answers to resolve the problems of the challenge 'Advent of the code' doing everythhing on python
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the reason that i stopped after the day 4 was that on day 5 i started at 7-8 pm, while I was reading the problem, I throught its easy, its just working with piles,
so I was doing it, but there were throwing some errors, it was something related to that a pile has no more objects, but the instruction ask to take 
'objects' (i dont remeber what it was), so it had taken and put nulls on the piles. In addition, I was frustated because I wanted to use switch on pythob, because 
there were +-9 piles, and somehow it wasnt working the switch, so in the end I abandoned the challenge and went to have fun playing something, and forgot to re-try 
or do the rest of problems of the challenge.
